A really simple PayPal plugin.

== Description ==

PayPal Responder processes payment for a product via PayPal, then sends an email responder to the customer and returns them to a URL of your choice. That's it.

You can use it to sell any type of product/s on your website. There is no cart, checkout process or anything complicated - it just lets the user buy a single product in 1 click, then returns them to a URL of your choice, and emails them the auto-responder.

= Example Usage =

Let's say you're selling an eBook. User clicks "Buy" button > user is directed through PayPal checkout > once checkout it completed user is returned to a thank you URL and emailed the eBook.

I developed this plugin for a usage similar to above example. I didn't want a fully fledged eCommerce system, and many other solutions include Add to Cart and then whole heap of other stop screens that hindered the transaction.

= Key Features =

*	Simple, light-weight PayPal plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What could I sell with this plugin? =

You can sell whatever you want. There aren't any fancy features in this plugin - like it doesn't have delivery options, order management etc so it's really designed for just a single simple product. For example I use it to sell access to a private site - after successful checkout user is sent the password to log in. You could use it for other similar things like to sell a PDF or eBook, or you might use it for selling a virtual product or service like say consultation services for example. 

= Can I add more than 1 product? =

Yes the plugin can have any number of products. But at this stage you can only set 1 return URL and 1 email auto-responder template.
If there are enough users interested I can add the ability to have custom return url and email responder for each product so get in touch and let me know if you want this.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
